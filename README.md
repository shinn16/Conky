# Conky
Various Conky's that I have made.
#### What is a conky?
A Conky is a Linux specific system monitor that builds into your desktop. You can learn more about them [here] (http://conky.sourceforge.net/documentation.html).

#### What is in this repository?
Any Conkies that I have made for use on my system. Feel free to use them for your own needs, but let it be known that it is unlikely
that these will work on your computer without modification. At the present time, I do not design these to work on multiple systems,
I design them to work on my machine specfically. It is easy however to modify parts of the scripts and get them to work on other systems.
Each file is commented, so you should be able to navigate and modify them rather easily.  
  
Each folder is a different Conky theme. These were built with the idea of using Conky manager in mind, so you may wish to install
it as it will make using them easier. I will make new themes as I change desktop backgrounds as I am that type of person. Again, each
folder is a different theme.

#### Issues and Trouble Shooting
Again, these were made for my stystem in particular. It is unlikely these will work straight out of the box, so they will need modifying.
The scripts are commented to help you along with this process. Think of these more as a template than a finished product.
